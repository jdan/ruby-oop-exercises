# Implement the ShoppingCart class here
#
# A ShoppingCart should:
# - Be initialized empty
# - Have add_item(name, price) to add items
# - Have remove_item(name) to remove items
# - Have total method that returns the sum of all item prices
# - Have item_count method that returns number of items
# - Items should NOT be directly accessible from outside
# - Have a apply_discount(percent) method that reduces total (use private helper)
