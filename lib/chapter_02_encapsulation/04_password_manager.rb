# Implement the PasswordManager class here
#
# A PasswordManager should:
# - Be initialized with a password (stored privately, never exposed)
# - Have an authenticate(attempt) method that returns true/false
# - Have a change_password(old_password, new_password) method
#   - Returns true and changes password if old_password is correct
#   - Returns false and keeps old password if old_password is wrong
# - The password should NEVER be accessible from outside the class
