# Implement the Counter class here
#
# A Counter should:
# - Be initialized with an optional start value (default 0)
# - Have a value method that returns the current count
# - Have an increment method that increases count by 1
# - Have a decrement method that decreases count by 1
# - Have a reset method that sets count back to the initial value
