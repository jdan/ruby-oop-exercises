# Implement the Playlist class here

# A Playlist should:
# - Be initialized with a name (starts with no songs)
# - Have an add_song method that adds a song to the playlist
# - Have a total_songs method that returns the number of songs
# - Have an includes? method that checks if a song is in the playlist
# - Have a first_song method that returns the first song (or nil if empty)
