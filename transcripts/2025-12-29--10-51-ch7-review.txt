⏺ Chapter 7 Review: SOLID Principles

  All 115 tests pass. Your solutions are well-structured and demonstrate strong understanding of SOLID. Here's my assessment:

  01_report_generator.rb (SRP) ✓

  Clean separation of concerns. Using Struct for SalesData is idiomatic Ruby. The heredoc in generate is elegant.

  02_discount_calculator.rb (OCP) ✓

  New discount types are extensible without modifying PriceCalculator. Nice touch using composition in SeasonalDiscount (line 102) by delegating to PercentageDiscount.

  The endless method definitions (def name = ...) are clean and modern Ruby.

  03_media_player.rb (LSP) ✓

  All MediaFile subtypes are properly substitutable. The three-level inheritance (PodcastEpisode → AudioFile → MediaFile) works cleanly.

  Minor: Line 84 has a redundant @artist = artist since super already handles it via AudioFile.

  04_worker_system.rb (ISP) ✓

  Small, focused interfaces that classes mix in selectively. RobotWorker only includes what it needs.

  Your comment on line 158 is spot-on — respond_to?(:take_break) would be the duck-typing approach vs. the current is_a? Feedable.

  05_notification_system.rb (DIP) ✓

  Proper dependency injection at two levels. MockSender demonstrates the testability benefit of DIP. The change_sender method shows runtime flexibility.

  ---
  Overall: These are well-crafted, idiomatic Ruby solutions. You've demonstrated not just how to apply SOLID principles, but also good Ruby style — Struct, endless methods, heredocs, and module composition. Nice work.
