> /model 
  ⎿  Set model to opus (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)

> I am interested in (1) writing more ruby (2) learning Object oriented 
programming best practices and design patterns. As such I'd like this repo 
to be a "gym" where I learn object oriented in ruby with a TDD approach. 

I'd like to run `rake spec` and see tests fail.

I'd like to start with maybe 3 "chapters" about OOP basics

I'd also like a CLAUDE.md in this repo so I can come back and generate more 
chapters. 

⏺ I'll help you set up a Ruby OOP learning gym with TDD! Let me first explore what currently exists in the directory and then plan out the structure.

⏺ Bash(ls -la /Users/jordan/Projects/ruby-oop-exercises)
  ⎿  total 0

     drwxr-xr-x@ 6 jordan  staff  192 Dec 27 09:12 ..

⏺ The directory is empty - perfect for a fresh start. Let me plan out the structure for your Ruby OOP gym.

⏺ Updated plan

⏺ Before I finalize the plan, I have a few questions:
                                                                         
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Are these three chapter topics what you'd like to start with? 
     (Classes/Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance) → Yes, those are great
     · How many exercises per chapter would you like? → 5-6 exercises
     · What difficulty level should the exercises target? → Mix of both

⏺ Now let me update the plan with the specific exercises for each chapter:

⏺ Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview

⏺ The plan is complete. Here's a summary:

  Plan Summary

  Structure: Standard Ruby project with RSpec and Rake

  3 Chapters, 5 exercises each (15 total, progressing easy → harder):

  | Chapter | Topic             | Exercises                                                       |
  |---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
  | 1       | Classes & Objects | Dog, Book, Rectangle, Counter, Playlist                         |
  | 2       | Encapsulation     | Person, Temperature, BankAccount, PasswordManager, ShoppingCart |
  | 3       | Inheritance       | Animal, Vehicle, Employee, Shape, GameCharacter                 |

  Files to create:
  - Gemfile, Rakefile, .rspec, spec/spec_helper.rb
  - 15 spec files with failing tests
  - 15 lib files with empty class stubs
  - CLAUDE.md with instructions for generating future chapters

  After setup, rake spec will show ~50+ failing tests ready for you to implement.

     Ruby OOP Exercises Gym - Setup Plan

     Overview

     Create a TDD-based Ruby learning repository for practicing 
     Object-Oriented Programming concepts. Each chapter has 5-6 exercises
     progressing from simple to more challenging.

     Files to Create

     Configuration Files

     - Gemfile - rspec (~> 3.12), rake
     - Rakefile - default task: spec
     - spec/spec_helper.rb - require lib files, RSpec config
     - .rspec - format options

     CLAUDE.md Content

     - Project purpose and structure
     - How to add new chapters
     - Conventions (file naming, exercise structure)
     - Example of a good exercise spec

     Per-Exercise Files

     - lib/chapter_XX/NN_name.rb - Empty class stub
     - spec/chapter_XX/NN_name_spec.rb - Failing tests

     ---
     TDD Approach

     - All specs written with clear describe/context/it blocks
     - Lib files contain only empty class definitions
     - Running rake spec shows all tests failing (red)
     - User implements code to make tests pass (green)

> How do I run just the tests for chapter 1? 

⏺ Run tests for just Chapter 1 with:

  bundle exec rspec spec/chapter_01_classes_and_objects/

  Or a single exercise:

  bundle exec rspec spec/chapter_01_classes_and_objects/01_dog_spec.rb

> add that info to the readme and claude.md
